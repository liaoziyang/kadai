The C5.0 System (Demonstration Version)
---------------------------------------

The C5.0 directory "bin" contains

    *  a decision tree and ruleset generator ("c5.0demo")
    *  a decision tree and ruleset interpreter ("predict")
    *  a csh script ("xval") for multiple cross-validations
    *  an ancillary program ("report") used by xval

The Linux version also includes
